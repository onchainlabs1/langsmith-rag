            Based on the EU AI Act, a system is considered high-risk if it meets specific criteria outlined in Article 6. 
            
            The main categories of high-risk AI systems include:
            
            1. **Biometric identification and categorization** of natural persons
            2. **Management and operation** of critical infrastructure  
            3. **Education and vocational training** systems
            4. **Employment, worker management** and access to self-employment
            5. **Access to and enjoyment of essential private services** and public services and benefits
            6. **Law enforcement** systems
            7. **Migration, asylum and border control** management
            8. **Administration of justice** and democratic processes
            
            These systems are subject to strict compliance requirements including risk management, data governance, 
            technical documentation, record keeping, transparency and provision of information to users, 
            human oversight, and accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity.
            
            The EU AI Act aims to ensure that AI systems are safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory 
            and environmentally friendly, while respecting fundamental rights.
