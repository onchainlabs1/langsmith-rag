# EU AI Act - Transparency Obligations

## Overview

Transparency obligations ensure that users are informed when they interact with AI systems and understand the capabilities and limitations of these systems. These obligations apply to limited-risk AI systems and are designed to promote trust and accountability.

## Limited-Risk AI Systems with Transparency Obligations

### AI Systems that Interact with Humans

**Definition**: AI systems that interact with natural persons and that are designed to interact with natural persons in a manner that is likely to cause them to believe that they are interacting with a natural person.

**Transparency Requirements**:
- Users must be informed that they are interacting with an AI system
- Users must be provided with information about the AI system's capabilities and limitations
- Users must be informed about their rights and remedies
- Users must be able to opt out of the interaction

**Examples**:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- AI-powered customer service systems
- AI systems used in education and training
- AI systems used in healthcare and medical diagnosis

### AI Systems that Generate or Manipulate Content

**Definition**: AI systems that generate or manipulate text, images, audio, or video content that is likely to cause persons to believe that the content is authentic and not generated or manipulated by an AI system.

**Transparency Requirements**:
- Users must be informed that the content is generated or manipulated by an AI system
- Users must be provided with information about the AI system's capabilities and limitations
- Users must be informed about their rights and remedies
- Users must be able to opt out of the interaction

**Examples**:
- AI systems that generate text content
- AI systems that manipulate images or videos
- AI systems that generate audio content
- AI systems that create deepfakes or synthetic media

## Information Requirements

### Information to be Provided to Users

**Basic Information**:
- Clear indication that the user is interacting with an AI system
- Information about the AI system's capabilities and limitations
- Information about the AI system's purpose and intended use
- Information about the AI system's data sources and training

**Technical Information**:
- Information about the AI system's architecture and algorithms
- Information about the AI system's performance and accuracy
- Information about the AI system's limitations and potential errors
- Information about the AI system's security and privacy measures

**Rights and Remedies**:
- Information about the user's rights under the AI Act
- Information about the user's right to opt out
- Information about the user's right to access and rectify data
- Information about the user's right to lodge complaints

### Information to be Provided to Competent Authorities

**Technical Documentation**:
- Comprehensive technical documentation of the AI system
- Information about the AI system's architecture and algorithms
- Information about the AI system's data sources and training
- Information about the AI system's performance and validation

**Compliance Documentation**:
- Documentation of compliance with transparency obligations
- Documentation of user information and consent
- Documentation of opt-out mechanisms
- Documentation of complaint handling procedures

## Implementation Requirements

### User Interface Design

**Clear and Prominent Information**:
- Information must be clear, prominent, and easily understandable
- Information must be provided in a timely manner
- Information must be accessible to all users
- Information must be provided in multiple languages where appropriate

**User-Friendly Design**:
- Information must be presented in a user-friendly manner
- Information must be easy to find and understand
- Information must be provided in appropriate formats
- Information must be accessible to persons with disabilities

### Consent and Opt-Out Mechanisms

**Informed Consent**:
- Users must provide informed consent before interacting with AI systems
- Consent must be freely given, specific, and unambiguous
- Consent must be informed and based on clear information
- Consent must be revocable at any time

**Opt-Out Mechanisms**:
- Users must be able to opt out of AI system interactions
- Opt-out mechanisms must be easily accessible
- Opt-out mechanisms must be effective and immediate
- Opt-out mechanisms must be documented and traceable

## Compliance and Enforcement

### Compliance Requirements

**Documentation**:
- Organizations must document their compliance with transparency obligations
- Documentation must be kept up to date
- Documentation must be made available to competent authorities
- Documentation must include user information and consent records

**Monitoring and Oversight**:
- Organizations must monitor their compliance with transparency obligations
- Organizations must implement appropriate oversight mechanisms
- Organizations must regularly review and update their compliance measures
- Organizations must document their monitoring and oversight processes

### Enforcement and Penalties

**Administrative Fines**:
- Up to â‚¬10 million or 2% of annual worldwide turnover
- Whichever is higher
- Fines are calculated based on the severity of the violation
- Fines are imposed by competent authorities

**Corrective Measures**:
- Orders to cease non-compliant practices
- Orders to implement corrective measures
- Orders to provide additional information to users
- Orders to implement opt-out mechanisms

### Best Practices

**Proactive Compliance**:
- Implement transparency obligations from the design phase
- Conduct regular compliance assessments
- Provide comprehensive user training and awareness
- Implement effective complaint handling procedures

**User-Centric Approach**:
- Design transparency obligations with users in mind
