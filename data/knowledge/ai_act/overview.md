# EU AI Act - Overview

## Purpose and Scope

The EU AI Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence systems in the European Union. It aims to ensure AI systems are safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory, and environmentally friendly.

## Key Principles

### Human Agency and Oversight
- AI systems must be designed to support human autonomy and decision-making
- Human oversight must be maintained throughout the AI system lifecycle
- Users must be able to understand and control AI system behavior

### Technical Robustness and Safety
- AI systems must be resilient to errors and attacks
- Fallback plans must be in place for system failures
- Continuous monitoring and testing required

### Privacy and Data Governance
- Personal data protection must be maintained
- Data quality and integrity must be ensured
- Appropriate data governance mechanisms required

### Transparency
- AI systems must be explainable and interpretable
- Users must be informed when interacting with AI systems
- Decision-making processes must be transparent

### Diversity, Non-discrimination, and Fairness
- AI systems must avoid bias and discrimination
- Diverse and representative datasets required
- Fair treatment of all individuals and groups

### Societal and Environmental Well-being
- AI systems must benefit society and the environment
- Sustainability considerations required
- Long-term societal impact assessment

## Risk Categories

### Prohibited AI Practices
- AI systems that manipulate human behavior
- AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities
- AI systems that create social scoring
- AI systems that create biometric categorization

### High-Risk AI Systems
- AI systems used in critical infrastructure
- AI systems used in education and training
- AI systems used in employment and worker management
- AI systems used in essential private and public services
- AI systems used in law enforcement
- AI systems used in migration and border control
- AI systems used in administration of justice

### Limited Risk AI Systems
- AI systems with transparency obligations
- AI systems that interact with humans
- AI systems that generate or manipulate content

### Minimal Risk AI Systems
- AI systems with no specific obligations
- Voluntary compliance encouraged
