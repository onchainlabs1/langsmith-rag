# EU AI Act - Conformity Assessment

## Overview

Conformity assessment is the process of demonstrating that high-risk AI systems comply with the requirements of the EU AI Act. This process ensures that AI systems meet the necessary safety, security, and fundamental rights standards before they can be placed on the market or put into service.

## Conformity Assessment Procedures

### Self-Assessment

**Applicable Systems**:
- High-risk AI systems that are not used in law enforcement
- High-risk AI systems that are not used in migration and border control
- High-risk AI systems that are not used in administration of justice

**Requirements**:
- Organizations must conduct a self-assessment of their AI systems
- Self-assessment must be documented and kept up to date
- Self-assessment must be made available to competent authorities
- Self-assessment must include risk assessment and mitigation measures

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Technical documentation of the AI system
- Risk assessment and mitigation measures
- Data governance and management practices
- Human oversight and control mechanisms
- Testing and validation procedures

### Third-Party Assessment

**Applicable Systems**:
- High-risk AI systems used in law enforcement
- High-risk AI systems used in migration and border control
- High-risk AI systems used in administration of justice
- High-risk AI systems that pose significant risks to fundamental rights

**Requirements**:
- Organizations must engage a notified body for conformity assessment
- Notified body must be independent and impartial
- Notified body must have appropriate expertise and resources
- Notified body must conduct a comprehensive assessment

**Assessment Process**:
- Review of technical documentation
- Assessment of risk management measures
- Evaluation of data governance practices
